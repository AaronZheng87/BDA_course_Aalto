Aalto 2020 course will be completely online. More info coming soon.

 - [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/user/index.php?id=28239) is used for important announcements and some questionnaires.
 - There will be a course slack

All the course material is available in a [git repo](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto) (and these pages are for easier navigation). All the material can be used in other courses. Text and videos licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0. Code licensed under BSD-3.

The material will be updated during the course. Exercise instructions and slides will be updated at latest on Monday of the corresponding week. The updated material will appear on web pages, or you can clone the repo and pull before checking new material. If you don't want to learn git, you can download the latest [zip file](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/archive/master.zip).

[The electronic version of the course book
Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd ed, by by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal
Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) is available for non-commercial purposes. Hard copies are available from [the publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/p/book/9781439840955) and many book stores.
See also [home page for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), [errata for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt), and [chapter notes](chapter_notes/BDA_notes.pdf).

## Communication channels

Primary communication channel is Slack.  If you have any questions, please try to ask the course staff or other students there (active students helping others will get bonus points).

Please also make sure your real name (first name + last name) is set correctly in Slack. However, if you wish to remain anonymous on Slack, it is also possible — you can simply pick a random nickname and leave your real name unspecified. However, please note that in those cases it may be more difficult for our course staff to provide help with problems you have encountered and you are not able to get [bonus points when helping others](assignments.html#Bonus_points).

In Slack, we will have separate channels for each assignment and the project.
Channel #general can be used for any kind of general discussions and questions related to the course. All important official announcements will be posted on #announcements (do not discuss on this channel). Any kind of feedback is welcome on channel #feedback. We have also got a channels #r, #python, and #stan for questions that are not specific to assignments or the project. Channel #queue is used as a queue for getting help during exercise sessions.

Our lecturers and teaching assistants have names with "(staff)" or "(TA)" in the end on Slack.

If you need one-to-one help, please take part in the [TA sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions) and ask there

If you find errors in material, post in #feedback channel in Slack or [submit an issue in github](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/issues).

## Assessment

[Assignments](assignments.html) (67\%) and a [project work with
presentation](project.html) (33\%). Minimum of 50\% of points must be
obtained from both the assignments and project work.

## Schedule 2020

Dates for 2020 fall will be updated 17th August.

Currently the video links are for the videos recorded 2019. Part of the videos will be re-recorded.

Sanasta "bayesilainen" esiintyy Suomessa muutamaa erilaista
kirjoitustapaa. Muoto "bayesilainen" on muodostettu yleisen
vieraskielisten nimien taivutussääntöjen mukaan 
> "Jos nimi on kirjoitettuna takavokaalinen mutta äännettynä etuvokaalinen, kirjoitetaan päätteseen tavallisesti takavokaali etuvokaalin sijasta, esim. Birminghamissa, Thamesilla." Terho Itkonen, Kieliopas, 6. painos, Kirjayhtymä, 1997.
