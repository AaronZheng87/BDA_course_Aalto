- Yes

### Q5 - 1 point

In a), is the reported resulting posterior correct ...?

- It is not reported, that the posterior distribution is a ... .
- It is reported, that the posterior distribution is ..., but the numerical values for the parameters are incorrect.
- It is reported, that the posterior distribution is ..., and the numerical values for the parameters are correct.

### Q6 - 1 point

In part b), is there at least one point estimate reported. Sample based estimates are also ok. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong due to a wrong posterior distribution being used. With the right posterior, mean, median, and mode are all approximately ....

- No
- Yes

### Q7 - 1 point

In part b), is the 90% posterior interval estimate reported? Sample based estimate is ok.

- No
- Yes

### Q8 - 1 point

In part c), is the posterior probability Pr(Ï€<0.2|y) reported? Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior used was wrong. If the posterior was right, the result should be approximately ....

### Q16 -

If in the previous question you selected either "I used considerably less time than I expected" or "I used considerably more time than I expected", please explain why you think the time used was considerably different from what you expected.
