# Assignment 9

## S1 · 7.5 points
Basic requirements

### Q1 · Yes / No · 1 point
Can you open the pdf?

### Q2 · Yes / No · 1 point
Is the report anonymous?

## S2 · 85 points
Exercise

### Q3 · Yes / No · 1 point
Is source code included?

### Q4 · Yes / No · 1 point
Is there a stan code provided that seems reasonable for the problem? The code doesn't have to be correct, as far as it is somewhat reasonable.

### Q5 · Yes / No · 1 point
Is there a reasonable code provided for computing the expected utilities for the six machines? (either as a part of Stan code or as separate R/Python code) The code doesn't have to be correct, as far as it is somewhat reasonable.

### Q6 · Scale · 1 point
Are the expected utilities computed and reported? (The utility should be of the form XXX or equivalently XXX. The utilities should be roughly XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX for the machines 1,2,...,6, respectively. If default settings for stan are used, roughly +/-4 variation due to random error can occur.)

- No
- Yes, but results are not correct (e.g. utility computed with wrong formula or samples from wrong distribution used) or some utilities are missing
- Yes, and all results are correct

### Q7 · Scale · 1 point
Are the machines ranked from worst to best? If the utilities were computed correctly, the order of the machines should be: XXX(worst),XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX(best).

- No
- Yes, but the order does not correspond to the reported expected utilities
- Yes, and all results are correct

### Q8 · Scale · 1 point
Is some discussion on the computed values for the expected utilities for the six machines provided? (E.g. [bla bla bla bla]) If there was a mistake in the utility computations it is OK if the discussion is correct with respect to obtained results.

- No
- Yes, but the provided discussion does not make sense or does not agree with the obtained results
- Yes

### Q9 · Yes / No · 1 point
Is there a reasonable code provided for computing the expected utility for the new (7th) machine? The code doesn't have to be correct, as far as it is somewhat reasonable.

### Q10 · Scale · 1 point
Is the expected utility for the new (7th) machine computed and reported? (If the utility is formulated as previously, the result should be roughly XXX, roughly +/-4 variation due to random error can occur.)

- No
- Yes, but it is wrong (e.g. wrong utility function or samples from wrong distribution)
- Yes and the result seems plausible

### Q11 · Scale · 1 point
Is some discussion provided whether the company should buy a new (7th) machine? (E.g.[bla bla bla bla]) If there was a mistake in the utility computations it is OK if the discussion is correct with respect to obtained results.

- No
- Yes, but the provided discussion does not make sense or is does not agree with the obtained results
- Yes


## S3 · 7.5 points
Overall quality of the report

### Q12 · Scale · 1 poin

Does the report follow the formatting instructions?

- Not at all
- Little
- Mostly
- Yes

### Q13 -

In case the report doesn't fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.

## S4 - X.X points

Time spent in the exercises.

### Q14 -

How was the time you used distributed in the assignment?

- I used most of the time dealing with programming language's burden.
- I used most time dealing with the exercise proper (math, derivations, etc.)
- I used as much time time in programming and exercise.

### Q15 -

How much time did you spend on the assignment?

- less than an hour
- 1 to 5 hours.
- more than 5 hours.

### Q16 -

How did the time you used in the assignment mach the time you expected to use?

- I used considerably less time than I expected.
- I used less time than I expected.
- I used roughly the time I expected.
- I used more time than I expected.
- I used considerably more time than I expected.

### Q17 -

If in the previous question you selected either "I used considerably less time than I expected" or "I used considerably more time than I expected", please explain why you think the time used was considerably different from what you expected.
