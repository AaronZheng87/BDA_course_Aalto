## Project work details

Project work involves choosing a data set and performing a whole analysis
according to all the parts of Bayesian workflow studied along the course.

There will be more updates for the instructions before the start of period II.

The project work is meant to be done in period II. In the beginning of the period II
  - form a group
  - select a topic (you may ask in the course chat for opinion whether it's agood topic)
  - start planning
  - the main work for the project and the presentation will be done in the second half of the period II
  - the online presentations will be made on the evaluation week after period II

## Groups

Porject work is done in groups of 1-3 persons. Preferred group size is
2-3. Groups of 1-2 persons are assumed to do same amount of work per
group. Group of 3 persons is assumed to do 50\% more work.

If you don't have a group, you can ask other students in the group
chat channel **#project**. Tell what kind of data you are interested
in (e.g. medicine, health, biological, engineering, politicial,
business), whether you prefer R or Python, and possibly if you have
already some idea for the topic.

## TA sessions

The groups will get help for the project work in [TA
sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions). When there are no weekly
assignments, the TA sessions are still organized for helping in the
project work.

## Evaluation

The project work's evaluation consists of

 - peergraded project report,
 - presentation and oral exam graded by the course staff.

## Project report

  - description of the data and the analysis problem,
  - description of at least two models, for example:
    - non hierarchical and hierarchical,
    - linear and non linear,
    - variable selection with many models,
  - informative or weakly informative priors, and justification of their
    choices,
  - Stan code (brms can be used to generate the code, but Stan code needs to be present and explained),
  - how to run the Stan model,
  - convergence diagnostics ($\widehat{R}$, ESS, divergences),
  - posterior predictive checks,
  - model comparison (e.g. with LOO-CV),
  - predictive performance assessment if applicable (e.g. classification
    accuracy),
  - sensitivity analysis with respect to prior choices,
  - discussion of issues and potential improvements.

## Project presentation

In addition to the submitted report, each project must be presented by the
authoring group, according to the following guidelines:

  - The presentation should be high level but sufficiently detailed information
    should be readily available to help answering questions from the audience,
  - the duration of the presentation should be 10 minutes (for 1-2 people
    groups) or 15 minutes (3 people groups),
  - at the end of the presentation there will be an extra 5-10 minutes of
    questions by anyone in the audience or two attending TAs,
  - grading will be done by the two TAs using standardized grading instructions
    
Specific recommendations for the presentations include:

  - The first slide should include project's title and group members' names,
  - the chosen statistical model(s), including likelihood and priors, must be
    explained and justified (you are *not* holding a presentation for a
    hypothetical customer that does not care about the details),
  - Make sure the font is big enough to be easily readable by the audience (this
    includes figure captions, legends and axis information!),
  - the grade will be reduced by one if the last slide does not contain actual
    information ("Thank you" or "Questions?" type of slides as final slides
    should be avoided),
  - in general, the best presentations are often given by teams that have
    frequently attended TA sessions and gotten feedback, so we strongly
    recommend attending these sessions.

## Data sets

We'll add some suggestions here

As some data sets have been overused for these particular goals, note that the
following ones are forbidden in this work (more can be added to this list so
make sure to check it regularly):

  - Titanic (R data set),
  - mtcars (R data set),
  - baseball batting (used by Bob Carpenter's StanCon case study).

## Model requirements

  - Every parameter needs to have an explicit proper prior. Improper flat priors
    are not allowed.
  - A hierarchical model is a model where the prior of certain parameter
    contain other parameters that are also estimated in the model. For instance,
    `b ~ normal(mu, sigma)`, `mu ~ normal(0, 1)`, `sigma ~ exponential(1)`.
  - Do not impose hard constrains on a parameter unless they are natural to
    them. `uniform(a, b)` should not be used for general parameters.
  - Models should include covariates. Modelling the outcome without predictors
    is likely too simple for this analysis.
  - `brms` can be used, but the Stan code must be included, briefly commented,
    and all priors need to be checked from the Stan code.
    

## Some examples

We'll add more examples here.

For similar notebooks we refer the student to:

  * BDA R demos https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_R_demos/tree/master/demos_rstan,
  * BDA Python demos
    https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_py_demos/tree/master/demos_pystan,
  * Stan case studies http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies.html,
  * StanCon case studies
    http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies.html (some of these
    notebooks are for a bigger projects, but reflect still the basic idea of a
    notebook presentation).
